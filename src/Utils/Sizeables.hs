-- Classes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

{-| 'Growable' is the class of types that can be grown. If a type is also
    'Bounded', then 'grow' 'maxbound' should result in a runtime error.

    For example:
    > data Nat = Z | S Nat deriving Eq
    > instance Zero Nat where zero = Z
-}
class Growable x where
    -- | 'grow': the successor of a value.
    grow :: x -> x

{-| 'Shrinkable' is the class of types that can be shrunk. If a type is also
    'Bounded', then 'shrink' 'minbound' should result in a runtime error.

    For example:
    > Shrinkable Nat where shrink Z = Z; shrink (S x) = x
-}
class Shrinkable x where
    -- | 'shrink': the predecessor of a value.
    shrink :: x -> x

{-| 'Zero' is the class of types for which a natural 'zero' is defined.

    For example:
    > instance Zero Nat where zero = Z

    We have that for any instance
    > (Zero x, Growable x, Shrinkable x, Eq x) => Enum x

    For example
    @
        instance Enum Nat where
        toEnum         = growZN
        fromEnum       = shrinkCZ
        succ           = grow
        pred           = shrink
        enumFrom       = growInf
        enumFromThen   = growThenInf
        enumFromTo     = growUntil
        enumFromThenTo = growThenUntil
