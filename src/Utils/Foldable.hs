-- if the function returns 'Just', then there's a match, otheriwse there's not.

-- | 'mfind': generalizes 'find' taking a "predicate" using 'Maybe' where
-- 'Nothing' rejects the element and 'Just' accepts it. It then it maybe finds
-- the leftmost element mapped, or 'Nothing' if all elements were rejected.
